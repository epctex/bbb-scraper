# Actor - BBB Scraper

## BBB scraper

Since BBB doesn't provide a good and free API, this actor should help you to retrieve data from it.

The BBB data scraper supports the following features:

-   Search any keyword - You can search any keyword you would like to have and get the results

-   Scrape companies - Extract any company information with all of its detail.

-   Scrape categories - Gather businesses for each of the categories.

-   Search for anything - If you want to get filtered data for the search results, just type the URL.

-   Retrieve reviews - BBB Scraper provides reviews for all the companies.

## Bugs, fixes, updates and changelog

This scraper is under active development. If you have any feature requests you can create an issue from [here](https://github.com/epctex/BBB-scraper/issues).

## Input Parameters

The input of this scraper should be JSON containing the list of pages on BBB that should be visited. Possible fields are:

- `search`: (Optional) (String) Keyword that you want to search on BBB.

- `country`: (Optional) (String) Country you want to search.

- `location`: (Optional) (String) Location you want to search.

- `startUrls`: (Optional) (Array) List of BBB URLs. You should only provide news list, jobs list or detail URLs.

- `includeReviews`: (Optional) (Boolean) This will add all the reviews that BBB provides inside the book object. Please keep in mind that the time and resources the actor uses will increase proportionally by the number of reviews.

- `endPage`: (Optional) (Number) Final number of page that you want to scrape. Default is `Infinite`. This is applies to all `search` request and `startUrls` individually.

- `maxItems`: (Optional) (Number) You can limit scraped items. This should be useful when you search through the big lists or search results.

- `proxy`: (Required) (Proxy Object) Proxy configuration.

- `extendOutputFunction`: (Optional) (String) Function that takes a JQuery handle ($) as argument and returns object with data.

This solution requires the use of **Proxy servers**, either your own proxy servers or you can use [Apify Proxy](https://www.apify.com/docs/proxy).

## Tip

**Please keep in mind that BBB.org blocks all the requests that are not coming from Canada, US and Mexico. That's why you should select a proper proxy group according to that.**

When you want to have a scrape over a specific listing URL, just copy and paste the link as one of the **startUrl**.

If you would like to scrape only the first page of a list then put the link for the page and have the `endPage` as 1.

With the last approach that explained above you can also fetch any interval of pages. If you provide the 5th page of a list and define the `endPage` parameter as 6 then you'll have the 5th and 6th pages only.

### Compute Unit Consumption

The actor optimized to run blazing fast and scrape many as listings as possible. Therefore, it forefronts all listing detail requests. If actor doesn't block very often it'll scrape 100 listings in 2 minutes with ~0.03-0.05 compute units.

### BBB Scraper Input example

```json
{
    "startUrls": [
        "https://www.bbb.org/us/ny/new-york/category/home-improvement",
        "https://www.bbb.org/us/ny/new-york/categories",
        "https://www.bbb.org/us/ny/new-york/profile/home-builders/jf-hughes-builders-inc-0121-87134180",
        "https://www.bbb.org/search?find_country=USA&find_entity=66005-000&find_id=1099_2800-400-1100&find_latlng=40.762801%2C-73.977818&find_loc=New%20York%2C%20NY&find_text=Clean%20Up%20Services&find_type=Category&page=1&sort=Relevance"
    ],
    "search": "business",
    "location": "new york",
    "country": "USA",
    "includeReviews": true,
    "proxy": {
        "useApifyProxy": true
    },
    "endPage": 5,
    "maxItems": 100
}
```

## During the Run

During the run, the actor will output messages letting you know what is going on. Each message always contains a short label specifying which page from the provided list is currently specified.
When items are loaded from the page, you should see a message about this event with a loaded item count and total item count for each page.

If you provide incorrect input to the actor, it will immediately stop with failure state and output an explanation of what is wrong.

## BBB Export

During the run, the actor stores results into a dataset. Each item is a separate item in the dataset.

You can manage the results in any languague (Python, PHP, Node JS/NPM). See the FAQ or <a href="https://www.apify.com/docs/api" target="blank">our API reference</a> to learn more about getting results from this BBB actor.
